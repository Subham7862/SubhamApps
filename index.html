                    Simple Calculator
                    <p>
                        I  started creating this basic, very basic, calculator on 10th March 2023 & finished creating this on 13th March 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I  created this using Microsoft .NET C# as the programming language & Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 as the Integrated Development Environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start off, I laid a basic plan to write the program using a Console Application. When everything was clear to me, I designed the Graphical User Interface using Windows Forms C# Application. I then copied the code of the Console to the Windows Forms, made the couple necessary changes & published it using "Microsoft Single Project MSIX Tools" Extension.
